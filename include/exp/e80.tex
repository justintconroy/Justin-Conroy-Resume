\item At Elettric80, I developed software for controlling laser guided
vehicle systems, conveyor systems, and other automation machinery. I also
developed, installed, and maintained warehouse management systems which
integrated with the robotic platforms Elettric80 develops. The software I
developed was written in C\# and SQL Server and communicated with robots,
PLC systems, and customer ERP systems. I worked directly with high profile
customers to ensure the quality of the product we delivered and to implement
custom features for every installation.
