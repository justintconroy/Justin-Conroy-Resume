\item At Elettric80, I develop software for controlling laser guided
vehicle systems, conveyor systems, and other automation machinery. I also
develop, install, and maintain a warehouse management systems which
integrate with the robotic platforms Elettric80 develops. The software I
develop is written in C\# and SQL Server and communicates with robots, PLC
systems, and customer ERP systems. I work directly with high profile
customers to ensure the quality of the product we deliver and to implement
custom features for every installation.
