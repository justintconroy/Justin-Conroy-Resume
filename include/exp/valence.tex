\item At Valence I mostly did backend development ETL (Extract,
Transform, Load) tasks. The company deals in healthcare insurance and I
was generally responsible for a lot of data coming in and going out to
vendors in a multitude of different formats. I used C\# and Entity
Framework to marshall data between files, web services, and databases.
I also worked on some user-facing applications in ASP.NET
to create tools for operations support staff to work more efficiently.
In this line of work, I dealt with a lot of Patient Health Information
and I take privacy of that information very seriously.
