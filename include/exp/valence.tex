\item At Valence I mostly do backend development ETL (Extract,
Transform, Load) tasks. The company deals in healthcare insurance and I
am generally responsible for a lot of data coming in and going out to
vendors in a multitude of different formats. I use C\# and Entity
Framework to marshall data between files, web services, and databases.
Recently I've also been working on some front end development in ASP.NET
to create tools for operations support staff to work more efficiently.
In this line of work, I deal with a lot of Patient Health Information
and take privacy of that information very seriously.
