\item At Kinoo, I developed firmware for the Kinoo Wand. An educational toy and
game controller powered by an ESP32. This project was written in C++, and used
FreeRTOS as a base. It included WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
connectivity. It also included some multicolored LEDs which played patterns
synced to music which was played on an onboard speaker. I designed a custom file
format with FlatBuffers to allow designers to create complex patterns and upload
them to the device filesystem (LittleFS). The controller also included an
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which included a gyroscope, accelerometer, and
magnetometer. The firmware processed data from this hardware to do complex
gesture recognition. In addition, the firmware was able to update itself using
Over-The-Air (OTA) updates. I also wrote custom code for managing updates to
media files on the device over the internet.
