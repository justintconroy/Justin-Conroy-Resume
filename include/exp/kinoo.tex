\item At Kinoo, I developed firmware for the Kinoo Wand. An educational toy and
game controller powered by an ESP32. This project was written in C++, and used
FreeRTOS as a base. It included WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
connectivity. It also included some multicolored LEDs which played patterns
synced to music which was played on an onboard speaker. I designed a custom file
format with FlatBuffers to allow designers to create complex patterns and upload
them to the device filesystem (LittleFS).
