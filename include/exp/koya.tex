\item At Koya, I was the lead backend developer for a custom web
application used by the company and their clients. I designed and
implemented a custom REST API to be consumed by a javascript frontend
created by the Frontend Developer. The backend was written primarily in
C\# and ASP.NET Core, with MS SQL Server as a supporting database. The
application ran on an Azure instance.
