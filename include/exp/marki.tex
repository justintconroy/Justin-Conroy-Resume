\item I designed and implemented embedded software for a new product that
Marki Microwave released. The product was a piece of lab test equipment
which interfaced wirelessly with software on a PC to provide test data
to users. I wrote an interface to LabView as well and provided a full
API for interacting with the device to allow users to write their own
programs for the device.
