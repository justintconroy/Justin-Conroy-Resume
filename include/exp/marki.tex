\item I design and implement embedded software for a new product that 
Marki Microwave will soon be releasing. The product is a piece of lab
test equipment which interfaces wirelessly with software.on a PC to
provide test data to users. When fully complete, the product will be
fully integrated with LabView, and an API will be provided such that
software written in any programming language will be able to interface
with the product.
