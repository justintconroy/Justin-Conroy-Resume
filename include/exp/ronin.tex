\item At Ronin, I developed firmware to control their surgical headlamp product.
The product was built on an ESP32. It was written in C++ and used FreeRTOS as a
base. The firmware used an SMBus connection to do smart battery management. It
also incorporated feedback from the high powered light using a custom Protocol
to manage fault conditions.
