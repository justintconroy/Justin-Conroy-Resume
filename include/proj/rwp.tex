	\textbf{Reaction Wheel Pendulum} \hfill Fall 2009
	\begin{description}
	\item The final project in my control systems course involved a complex
	system known as a reaction wheel pendulum.  It is essentially an inverted
	pendulum which is actuated by a spinning flywheel at the end of the pendulum
	(rather than a motor at the base of the pendulum, as would be present in a
	normal inverted pendulum). This created an interesting control problem.
	Working with a partner, I performed system identification on the reaction
	wheel pendulum, and then experimented with many different control algorithms
	to control the movement of the pendulum, including stabilization using
	two-state feedback, stabilization using three-state feedback, and a full-order
	observer.
