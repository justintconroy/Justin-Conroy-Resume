	\textbf{Autonomous Recycling Robot} \hfill Spring 2010
	\begin{description}
	\item For the final project of the Mechatronics course, I worked
	on a team of four people to program a DSP on a mobile robot. The robot
	collected a can at the beginning of a course and carried it to the
	center of the course and, using computer vision, placed it next to
	a pink square. While doing this, the robot also collected colored
	golf balls placed semi-randomly throughout the course. At the end of
	the course, the robot deposited each color of golf ball in its own area.
