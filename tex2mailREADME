tex2mail is a perl script to convert TeX files into
plain text files: various mathematical symbols
(sums, products, integrals, sub/superscripts, fractions, square
roots,...) are replaced by "ascii art" that spreads over
multiple lines if necessary. The result attemps to approach WYSIWYG
and is more readable to human beings than the flat-style TeX code.

Installation:
Adapt the source code to your local needs by change of
the first line of the tex2mail file for the correct
full path name of your perl executable.

Invocation:

tex2mail [-linelength <bytesperline> ] [-debug <level> ]
         [-by_par] [-TeX] [-ragged] [-noindent] < foo.tex > foo.txt
